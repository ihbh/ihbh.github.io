# What's this?

In short, it's an app that shares your location with others: you go somewhere, open this app, send your location and others see that you've been there. The idea is that likeminded people go to the same places, but not necessarily at the same time, and this app helps them to find each other.

This web app is meant to work as a Progressive Web App (PWA) to avoid hurdles with Android and iOS app stores.
