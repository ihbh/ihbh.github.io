# Data Export & Import

All your data, including profile image, keys, visited places and chat messages, is stored locally on your phone. Only a small portion of it is uploaded to the server. If you lose this data, you won't be able to regain access to the account.

On the main page, notice the settings icon:

Click Export to generate a json file with a copy of your data.

The json file contains everything, including keys, passwords and so on.

When you create an account, there is an option to import data from this json file:
