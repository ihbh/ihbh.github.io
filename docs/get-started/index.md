# Getting Started

The app is meant to be used on iOS/Android phones because the whole point is to share your GPS coordinates and see others who had visited the same place.

## Create Account

Open [ihbh.org](https://ihbh.org) on mobile Chrome, Firefox, Safari or whatever browser you have. Since you don't have an account, you'll see something like this:

![](/docs/img/pages/reg-0.jpg)

Enter any username above, upload some picture if you want to, and click Done.

![](/docs/img/pages/reg-1.jpg)

The app will create an account for you.

## Install the web app as a PWA

Then it will ask to create an app icon on your phone:

![](/docs/img/pages/pwa-1.jpg)
![](/docs/img/pages/pwa-2.jpg)

You'd better agree.

Now you can close the browser and use the app icon instead:

It will run the same browser, but without unnecessary UI elements, so the web app will look more like a native app:

## Share your location

Click the big "I've Been Here" button to share your GPS coordinates. The app will show if anyone has been at about the same place in past:

The app sends your coordinates only once. It doesn't monitor your location.

Click on any of these users to chat:

Messages are encrypted.

## See all your visited places

The app stores locally all the places you've shared:
