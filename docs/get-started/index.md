# Getting Started

The app is meant to be used on iOS/Android phones because the whole point is to share your GPS coordinates and see others who had visited the same place.

Open [ihbh.org](https://ihbh.org) on mobile Chrome, Firefox, Safari or whatever browser you have. Since you don't have an account, you'll see something like this:

Enter any username above, upload some picture if you want to, and click Done.
