# Install the web app as a PWA

Then it will ask to create an app icon on your phone:

![](/docs/img/pages/pwa-1.jpg)
![](/docs/img/pages/pwa-2.jpg)

You'd better agree.

Now you can close the browser and use the app icon instead:

![](/docs/img/pages/pwa-3.jpg)

It will run the same browser, but without unnecessary UI elements, so the web app will look more like a native app:
